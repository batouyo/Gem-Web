A hybrid supervised fusion deep learning framework for microscope multi-focus images
The quality of multi-focus microscopic image fusion hinges upon the precision of the image registration technology.   Due to the presence of fuzzy regions and weak textures of multi-focus microscope images, the registration of patches is suboptimal.    However, algorithms for registration tailored specifically for multifocal microscopic images are lacking. We want to develop a comprehensive chain pipeline for fusion based on the registration process utilizing hybrid supervision methods to improve registration accuracy.
