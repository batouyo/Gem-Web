[Advanced U-Net for Multi-class Segmentation of Mammography]

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies worldwide, taking countless lives each year. Detecting cancer in its early stages through accurate, efficient, and economical methods is essential to reduce its impact. Although mammary ductal images have been foundational in diagnosing breast cancer, refining their accuracy and efficiency remains a challenge.

Mammography, especially when using mammary ductal images, is crucial in breast cancer screening. It provides a non-invasive technique to spot potential anomalies. Early detection via precise image analysis not only plays a key role in halting the disease's progression but also markedly improves the survival rates of patients. However, interpreting mammograms requires specialized expertise. The limited availability of skilled radiologists underscores the necessity for a reliable, automated solution.

The inception of our project was driven by the integration of deep learning into mammographic image analysis. We adapted the widely acclaimed U-Net architecture to meet our specific goal: detailed and multi-class segmentation of mammary ductal images.

Key Innovations:

Multi-class Pretraining: We harness the power of extensive multi-class pretraining, imbuing the model with a profound comprehension of diverse image attributes and abnormalities. This leads to a more nuanced and accurate image segmentation.

SAM Prompt: By implementing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) prompt engineering, we enhance the model's rate of convergence. Moreover, it significantly amplifies the model's robustness and precision, enabling it to detect subtle structures and anomalies within the images.
